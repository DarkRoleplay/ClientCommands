## Pull Requests
**Please do not create Pull Requests, without asking on our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/WCy3xrT) beforehand!**  
Otherwise your pull request will most likely be rejected, and your work was wasted.

As for my reasoning, I am maintaining quite a few mods on my own. And I want to be able to choose what I work on on my own.
Something that isn't really possible/polite to do when you create pull requests. 
Even when they are great and extremely high quality, I have to check the code first and test it ingame.
Additionally for anything that is not just a bugfix but affects gameplay in any way, we do have a vision for our mods, 
you most likely won't know that reason before talking with us. So please, give me the freedom of using my free time to work on things I want to.
And not on things I am forced to work on.
